üëâ [Support my work via GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/xenodium)

Hi, I‚Äôm √Ålvaro üëã
- I do software engineering for a living.
- I live in an [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs) buffer somewhere in London.
  - My Emacs [config](https://github.com/xenodium/dotsies/tree/main/emacs) is available in the [dotsies](https://github.com/xenodium/dotsies) repo.
- I write about all sorts of things at [xenodium.com](https://xenodium.com).
- I've written a few Emacs packages you may like:
  - [dwim-shell-command](github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command)
  - [chatgpt-shell](github.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell)
  - [org-block-capf](github.com/xenodium/org-block-capf)
  - [company-org-block](github.com/xenodium/company-org-block)
  - [ob-swiftui](github.com/xenodium/ob-swiftui)
- Inspired by [Atomic Habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits), I wrote [Flat Habits](https://flathabits.com) for iOS. Now on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1558358855).
- I'm an [Org mode](https://orgmode.org/) fan, so I wrote [Plain Org](https://plainorg.com) for iOS. Also on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1578965002).
- I needed an Emacs-inspired \*scratch\* buffer on iOS (who doesn't?), so I built [\*scratch\*](https://xenodium.com/scratch-a-minimal-scratch-area/).
- You can find more about me over at [xenodium.com](https://xenodium.com) or just ping on [mastodon](https://indieweb.social/@xenodium) or [twitter](https://twitter.com/xenodium).
